# Product Context

## Why Family Stories Exists

Family memories are often fragmented and incomplete. Different family members remember events differently, and without a way to collaboratively document and share these memories, important details get lost over time. Family Stories solves this by providing a dedicated platform where family members can collectively build comprehensive narratives of their shared experiences.

## Problems Solved

- **Fragmented Memories**: Family events are remembered differently by each person, leading to incomplete stories
- **Lost Details**: Important context, emotions, and small moments fade without proper documentation
- **Communication Gaps**: Family members struggle to share and discuss past events effectively
- **Generational Knowledge Transfer**: Younger generations miss out on detailed family history
- **Physical Media Limitations**: Photos and videos exist in silos, hard to organize and share collaboratively

## How It Works

Family Stories is a collaborative web platform where:

1. **Family Groups**: Users create or join family groups with defined membership
2. **Event Creation**: Any member can start documenting a family event (weddings, vacations, holidays, milestones)
3. **Multi-Perspective Documentation**: Each family member contributes their unique perspective, memories, and details
4. **Rich Media Integration**: Photos, videos, and documents are attached to events
5. **Discussion & Refinement**: Members can comment, ask questions, and collaboratively improve the documentation
6. **Timeline View**: Events are organized chronologically, creating a living family history

## User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive Collaboration**: Easy for non-technical family members to participate
- **Emotional Connection**: Platform should feel warm, personal, and family-oriented
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works well on any device, with rich features for power users
- **Privacy First**: Strong privacy controls ensure family content stays within the family
- **Inclusive Design**: Accessible to all ages and technical abilities
- **Joy of Discovery**: Users should enjoy exploring and contributing to family history

## Success Metrics
